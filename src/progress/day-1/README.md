## What I learned

An algorithm is a set of steps that take an input and produces an output in a finite amount of time.

Algorithms are everywhere. We use them all the time even we don't realize them. It ranges from sorting a bunch of books in the shelf to solving the real-world problems.

By the way, I also learned about the NP-complete, which basically refers to the problems with no efficient algorithm to solve.
